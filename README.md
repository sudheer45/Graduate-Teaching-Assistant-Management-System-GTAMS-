The system facilitates application submissions by TA applicants, course requirement management by department staff, TA assignment decisions by committee members, and performance evaluations by instructors. By integrating role-specific functionalities, GTAMS ensures efficient TA selection, assignment, and feedback processes, enhancing overall administrative efficiency and decision-making transparency.
